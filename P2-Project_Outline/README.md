    1. Overview: In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?
          Zac Frost is a very talented artist and animator with a lot of potential, but not a lot of good exposure.  This project will improve his online presence by providing him a more consistent and professional way to display his portfolio and present himself to potential employers and those who want to commission work from him.
          The project will aim to maximize his exposure by simplifing the process of purchasing his work or commissioning him for other work through a dynamic, platform naive interface integrating all parts of communication into the site.
    2. Features: 
    • User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
    • Admin login: Admins will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each admin will have permissions to upload, modify, and move images in a gallery format that can be viewed full-screen when clicked.
        ◦ Purchase: Users will be able to purchase artwork.
        ◦ Create Post: Users will be able to create new blog posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the user’s profile.
    3. Technologies: 
        ◦ Java
        ◦ Spring Boot
        ◦ MySQL
        ◦ Hibernate
        ◦ JavaScript
        ◦ HTML
        ◦ CSS
    4. What you’ll have to learn: In the course of building your project, you’ll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your front-end more interactive. If you can’t name the exact technology or technique that you’ll have to learn, you should still be able to describe a problem that you have identified that you don’t currently know how to solve.
